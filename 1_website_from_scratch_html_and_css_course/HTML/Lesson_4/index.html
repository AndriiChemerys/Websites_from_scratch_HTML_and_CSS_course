                <p>This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things. I'll be sure to use the <abbr title="HyperText Marckup Language">HTML</abbr> tags I've been learning how to code.</p>
                <p>This is another paragraph, and I would like to quote the late, great Martin Luther King, Jr. who once said <q>I have a dream</q>.</p>
                <blockquote cite="http://www.somesite.com">
                    <p>I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.
                    </p>
